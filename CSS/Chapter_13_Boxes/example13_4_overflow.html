        <div class="overflow-example overflow-scroll">
            <h2 class="text-center">scroll</h2>
            <p>In this example the paragraph width and height are fixed and the text overflows
                the container. The overflow property is set to scroll. If using a laptop or desktop, you should see
                the vertical and horizontal scrollbars. If you are using an ipad or phone, you should be able to swipe
                up to view the content. Other options for overflow are visible, hidden, and auto.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="overflow-example overflow-auto">
            <h2 class="text-center">auto</h2>
            <p>In this example the paragraph width and height are fixed and the text overflows the container. The
                overflow property is set to auto. If using a laptop or desktop, you should see the vertical scrollbar.
                Since the horizontal scrollbar is not needed, the browser does not display it. If you are
                using an ipad or phone, you should be able to swipe up to view the content. Other options for
                overflow are scroll, visible, and hidden.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="overflow-example overflow-hidden">
            <h2 class="text-center">hidden</h2>
            <p>In this example the paragraph width and height are fixed and the text overflows
                the container. The overflow property is set to hidden. If using a laptop or desktop, you should not see
                scrollbars and the text that overflows is hidden. There is no way to scroll to see the hidden text. This
                is generally not a good user experience. Other options for overflow are scroll, auto, and visible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="overflow-example overflow-visible">
            <h2 class="text-center">visible</h2>
            <p>In this example the paragraph width and height are fixed and the text overflows
                the container. The overflow property is set to visible. If using a laptop or desktop, you should not see
                scrollbars and the text that overflows is visible outside of the container. This
                is generally not a good user experience. Other options for overflow are scroll, auto, and hidden.</p>
